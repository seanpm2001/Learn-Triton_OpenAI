About:
I decided to make Triton (OpenAI) the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Triton-OpenAI) as Triton (OpenAI) is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Triton (OpenAI) programming language. It only makes sense to Triton (OpenAI) the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
